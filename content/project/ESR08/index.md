This project is about the application of the direct interconnection technique (DIT) to marine renewable energy (MRE) devices, specifically for offshore non-reversing pumping mode AWE systems. The results show that the DIT can improve the ruggedness of the offshore installation by relocating power converters to shore. A laboratory hardware setup has been developed to emulate a small AWE farm. The measurements prove the theoretical expectations and the technical feasibility of the DTI for non-reversing pumping mode AWE devices. Simulation models have been developed to research with more flexibility. The performance of directly interconnected AWE systems under normal and fault conditions has been studied and the quality of the power generated by the directly interconnected AWE systems has been evaluated. Proper controllers have been developed to control the load balance and reactive power exchange of the directly interconnected AWE generators. Implementing the proposed active and reactive power controllers leads to a notable improvement in power quality.
