Ampyx Power is aiming at the deployment of large-scale AWE systems. Currently, the company is testing a 30 kW prototype ([AP2](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:12f6e9d3-c69e-4d5c-9f6f-5882c1e4bf93)) and improves the software algorithms while building a 200 kW prototype ([AP3](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:53286eb3-3e58-4f33-accf-c80c4876a60a)). A target 2 MW system ([AP4](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-1947-0_26)) is in planning. For the 200 kW system a new launching and landing system is in development and currently in the design stage. The automation of launching and landing is challenging because of the complexity of the launching and landing system and the requirement of being able to launch and land safely within a limited area. This project has two goals. Firstly, to support the design of the launching and landing system and the power generation system with the development of computer algorithms that are able to optimize flight trajectories for the airborne wind energy system. Secondly, to investigating suitable stopping/arresting mechanisms for the precommercial prototype AP3. An arresting hook is proposed together with the ground-based arresting lines to achieve rapid deceleration within a limited landing distance as the solution for AP3 due to the many advantages it has over other types of arresting mechanisms.
