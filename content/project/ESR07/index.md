The electrical drive, to which the rigid/soft kite is coupled, is of pivotal importance; since it controls the electromechanical energy conversion. The current trend of employing standard off-the-shelf three-phase drives are susceptible to common faults, such as partial/full inverter leg failure, which reduces not only the generated power up to 33%, but can also jeopardise the operation of the AWE system. The PhD fellow focused on employing IPMSM-based six phase drives for enhanced fault-tolerance and power/weight ratio. High fidelity mathematical models, controller design in the healthy/post-fault cases as well as encoderless control were considered in this study.
