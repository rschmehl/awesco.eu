Modeling AWE systems and studying the role of the technology in the future energy system is crucial for its early-stage development. The main objective of this project is the development of a mathematical model and power optimization problem for AWE systems, to study the integration of AWE in the power system. In detail, a mathematical model of an AWE system is developed and implemented in an optimal control framework with the aim of optimizing the flight trajectory in order to maximize the average power generation. To investigate the annual hourly power production at specific locations, real wind data is gathered and implemented in the optimal control framework. The production of AWE systems is analyzed and compared to the production of traditional wind power plants. Further, it is planned to implement the power production into an electrical energy system model that simulates the future power system. The goal is to investigate the value and the possible role of AWE systems in the energy system at different European locations.
