Airborne wind energy systems extract power from the wind environment in which they operate.
This wind environment is, however, chaotic and difficult to predict. We provide a state-of-the-art
simulation framework using large-eddy simulations to compute complete time-resolved three-dimensional
wind fields and investigate the interaction between airborne wind energy systems and
the wind environment. The generated datasets provide a virtual testing environment for controller
design and performance estimation of airborne wind energy systems. In addition, the proposed
framework incorporates the effects of airborne wind energy systems onto the development of the
wind flow. With this virtual flight simulator, new insights on the structure of the wind field in the
context of airborne wind energy can be gained and can be used to increase the efficiency of power
extraction.
