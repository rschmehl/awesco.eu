Jonas Koenemann was Marie-Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellow at Ampyx Power BV, working with [Soeren Sieberling](/authors/soeren-sieberling). He was affiliated with the University of Freiburg, collaborating with Prof. Dr. [Moritz Diehl](/authors/moritz-diehl/). His PhD research was about the [control of launching and landing the tethered aircraft on a launch platform](/project/esr09/). Within this frame he developed the open source software tools [openAWE](https://github.com/openawe/openawe) and [openOCL](https://openocl.org/). Before starting his doctoral research, he spent one semester of his studies at the [University of La Laguna](https://www.ull.es/en/), Spain, and completed a 7 months internship at the [LAAS-CNRS institute](https://www.laas.fr/public/en) in Toulouse, France, with novel results in applying non-linear model predictive control to a full-size humanoid robot. He currently is PhD researcher at the University of Freiburg, working with Prof. Diehl and continuing the development of open source software tools and specific applications, such as [modeling for reinforcement learning and optimal control](https://medium.com/@JonasCoen/modeling-for-reinforcement-learning-and-optimal-control-double-pendulum-on-a-cart-394f46b7ec7e).
