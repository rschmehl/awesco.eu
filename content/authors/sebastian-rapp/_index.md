Sebastian Rapp is Marie-Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at Delft University of Technology, working with Dr. [Roland Schmehl](/authors/roland-schmehl/). His research is about [robust flight control](/project/esr02/) of airborne wind energy systems. In this field he has also collaborated extensively with the Norwegian company [Kitemill](http://www.kitemill.com), which is a partner organization in the AWESCO network. During his masters studies at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.fsd.mw.tum.de/) he focused on Flight System Dynamics and Control Theory. He spent one year (2012-2013) at the [Institut Supérior de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace (ISAE-SUPAERO)](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/) in Toulouse, France.
