Ashwin Candade is Marie-Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at EnerKíte GmbH, Berlin, working with Dr. [Alexander Bormann](/authors/alexander-bormann/) and [Maximilian Ranneberg](/authors/maximilian-ranneberg/), and Delft University of Technology, working with Dr. [Roland Schmehl](/authors/roland-schmehl/). His research is about [multidisciplinary system design, safety and cost optimization](/project/esr12/) of AWE systems, with a focus on the structural aspects of carbon composite rigid wing technology. Before starting his doctoral research he graduated from Delft University of Technology in the [Flight Performance and Propulsion](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/ae/msc-aerospace-engineering/master-tracks/flight-performance-and-propulsion/) track. His thesis was an experimental aerodynamic and aeroacoustic investigation into the [interaction effects between a rotor slipstream and a trailing pylon](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:e7e16208-8b9a-457e-9bdc-87e65e4c9135).
