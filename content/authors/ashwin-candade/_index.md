Ashwin Candade was Marie-Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at EnerKíte GmbH, Berlin, working with Dr. [Alexander Bormann](/authors/alexander-bormann/) and [Maximilian Ranneberg](/authors/maximilian-ranneberg/), while being affiliated with Delft University of Technology and collaborating with Dr. [Roland Schmehl](/authors/roland-schmehl/). In 2019 he transferred to the university, maintaining his affiliation with the company. His research is about [multidisciplinary system design, safety and cost optimization](/project/esr12/) of AWE systems, with a focus on the structural aspects of carbon composite rigid wing technology. Following his BSc in Mechanical engineering from SRM University, Chennai, he worked for 2 years at the National Aerospace Laboratories, India. He then came to TU Delft, where he did his Masters in Aerospace Engineering, in the Flight Performance and Propulsion track. For his master thesis, he performed an experimental aerodynamic and aeroacoustic investigation into the interaction effects between a rotor slipstream and a trailing pylon. His research interests include multidisciplinary optimization, simplified aerodynamic and structural models and knowledge based systems.
