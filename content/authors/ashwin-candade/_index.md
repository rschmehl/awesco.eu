Ashwin Candade is a Marie-Skłodowska-Curie Fellow and PhD candidate with the Delft University of Technology, working with EnerKíte, Berlin. Following his bachelors degree in Mechanical engineering from SRM University, Chennai, he worked for about 2 years at the National Aerospace Laboratories, India. He then came to TU Delft, where he did his Masters in Aerospace Engineering, in the Flight Performance and Propulsion track. For his master thesis, he performed an experimental aerodynamic and aeroacoustic investigation into the interaction effects between a rotor slipstream and a trailing pylon. His research interests include multidisciplinary optimisation, simplified aerodynamic and structural models and knowledge based systems.
