Dr. Colin Jones is an Associate Professor in the Automatic Control Laboratory at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. He was a Senior Researcher at the [Automatic Control Laboratory](https://control.ee.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich until 2011 and obtained a PhD in 2005 from the University of Cambridge for his work on polyhedral computational methods for constrained control. He has worked in a variety of industrial roles, ranging from commercial building control to the development of custom optimization tools focusing on retail human resource scheduling. His current research interests are in the theory and computation of predictive control and optimization, and their application to green energy generation, distribution and management.
