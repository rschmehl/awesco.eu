Paul Thedens started as Marie-Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellow with [Skysails GmbH](http://www.skysails.info/en/), working with [Bernd Specht](/authors/bernd-specht), later continuing with the University of Freiburg. He is affiliated with Delft University of Technology, collaborating with Dr. [Roland Schmehl](/authors/roland-schmehl/). His project is about [durable structural reinforcements of large-scale fabric kites](/project/esr10) for airborne wind energy, for which he has developed the finite element simulation tool [mem4py](https://github.com/pthedens/mem4py). Before starting his doctoral research, he graduated from the [European Wind Energy Master (EWEM)](https://ewem.tudelft.nl/) program, with a project on [topology optimization of thin membranes applied to a parafoil rib](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:9178f436-a0c3-4365-814a-3b375b2231c9). He presently works as research engineer for [Skysails Power GmbH](https://www.skysails.info/en/power/).
