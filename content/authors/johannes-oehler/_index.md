Johannes Oehler was researcher at Delft University of Technology, working with Dr. [Roland Schmehl](/authors/roland-schmehl/) in the EU Horizon 2020 "Fast Track to Innovation" project [REACH](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/199241/). His research was about experimental characterization of soft kites with a focus on the coupled aerodynamics and deformation behavior of the wing and the effect on the flight dynamics. Prior to this assignment, he finalized his masters studies at the [University of Stuttgart](http://www.uni-stuttgart.de) with a graduation project at Delft University of Technology and [Kitepower BV](http://www.kitepower.nl) on [measuring the relative flow experienced by a flexible wing kite](http://dx.doi.org/10.18419/opus-9890).
