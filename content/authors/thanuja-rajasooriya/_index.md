Thanuja Rajasooriya was Marie-Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellow at Ampyx Power BV, working with [Soeren Sieberling](/authors/soeren-sieberling). Her project was about [control of launching and landing the tethered aircraft on a launch platform](/project/esr09/). Within this frame she designed an arresting mechanism for the precommercial prototype AP3. Before joining Ampyx Power BV she worked for 5 years for [2H Offshore](https://2hoffshore.com/) on the design and numerical analysis of subsea systems.
