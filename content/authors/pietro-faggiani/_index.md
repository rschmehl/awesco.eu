Pietro Faggiani works as systems engineer at Kitepower BV. He is a trained operator for the 100 kW [AWE system](https://kitepower.nl/tech/) that the company is developing, supervises test campaigns and the production of new kites. For his graduation project at Delft University of Technology he investigated the performance and generation characteristics of a [pumping kites wind farm](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:66cddbd2-5f50-4fc7-be0b-468853128f37) using computational simulations. Early in his masters studies he spent 5 months as intern at [KiteGen Research Srl](http://kitegen.com/).
