Dr. Sébastien Gros is guest professor at Chalmers University of Technology and full professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. He conducts research on energy-related problems and optimal control. He obtained his PhD in 2008 when working for the [Automatic Control Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/la/) of EPFL and did his post-doc with [OPTICON](https://www.astro-opticon.org/)/[OPTEC](https://set.kuleuven.be/optec) at KU Leuven. He contributed a chapter on the [modeling of airborne wind energy systems in natural coordinates](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39965-7_10) to the Springer textbook [Airborne Wind Energy](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39965-7) published in 2013.
