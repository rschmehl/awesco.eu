Johannes Peschel is CEO of the startup company Kitepower, which he founded together with Dr. [Roland Schmehl](/authors/roland-schmehl/) in 2016. The company commercially develops a 100 kW airborne wind energy system based on the technology platform that Delft University of Technology was developing and testing since 2010. From September 2014 until July 2015 he was part of the [Kitepower 2.0](http://www.kitepower.eu/newsevents/81-kite-power-20.html) project of Delft University of Technology, which eventually led to the EU Horizon 2020 "Fast Track to Innovation" project [REACH](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/199241/). Kitepower is a partner organization in the AWESCO network, providing opportunities for secondments to the PhD researchers.
