Dr. Axelle Viré supervises several PhD students working on numerical modeling for wind energy applications, mostly developing high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics models for fluid-structure interaction. She applies her models to airborne wind energy applications as well as conventional wind turbine rotors and floating offshore wind turbines. She is a Principal Investigator in the H2020-WIDESPREAD project [TWIND](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/224083/factsheet/en) aiming at creating a network of excellence between specialized research professionals and trainees in the field of offshore wind energy. She also coordinates the [Offshore Wind Energy Minor](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ae/education/minors/offshore-wind-energy-minor/) at Delft University of Technology. Before starting in Delft, she was Marie Curie post-doctoral Research Fellow at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). She was involved in the development of the open source CFD package [Fluidity](https://fluidityproject.github.io/). In 2013 she received the FP7 Marie Curie Career Integration Grant [NUMIWING](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/110013/factsheet/en).
