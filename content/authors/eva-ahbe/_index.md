Eva Ahbe is Marie-Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellow at ETH Zurich, working with Prof. [Roy Smith](/authors/roy-smith/). Her PhD research is about [modeling and periodic control of dynamically uncertain airfoils](/project/esr13/), for which she has developed an open source tool for [airborne wind energy trajectory analysis](https://github.com/evaahbe/AWE_tool/). Her master studies included a 12 months research period at the [Carnegie Institution for Science](https://carnegiescience.edu/) at Stanford, CA, USA.
