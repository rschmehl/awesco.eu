Mikko Folkersma is Marie-Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at Delft University of Technology, working with Dr. [Roland Schmehl](/authors/roland-schmehl/) and Dr. [Axelle Viré](/authors/axelle-vire/). His research is about [fluid structure interaction of flexible membrane wings](/project/esr01/) for airborne wind energy generation. He has developed a [preCICE-adapter](https://github.com/precice/mbdyn-adapter) that allows for coupling the open source computational fluid dynamics package [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org/) with the open source multibody dynamics analysis solver [MBDyn](https://www.mbdyn.org/). Before starting in Delft, he worked at the [Institut Supérior de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace (ISAE-SUPAERO)](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/) in Toulouse, France, on his graduation project on [large eddy simulation of a jet in crossflow](doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-63212-4_10) modeling a film cooling configuration for gas turbine blades (April to July 2015).
