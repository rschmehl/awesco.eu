Markus Sommerfeld is PhD researcher at the University of Victoria, working with Prof. Dr. [Curran Crawford](/authors/curran-crawford/). His research is about the assessment of wind resources in higher altitudes through measurements and a variety of simulations as well as using this information to estimate optimal operating conditions, predicting annual energy production and estimating their cost. For his graduation project at the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy & Energy System Technology in Bremerhaven he was part of the "BladeMaker" team, designing and implementing a test bench for the investigation of automated rotor blade spar cap manufacturing. During a six months internship (2013-2014) at TÃœV Rheinland in Yokohama Japan he conducted tests on PV modules and analyzed the results according to international safety, quality and performance standards. He worked at Airbus Hamburg Germany (2012) on the certification of various airplane parts, designing the necessary mechanical load test device for cargo loading devices and conducted first test.
