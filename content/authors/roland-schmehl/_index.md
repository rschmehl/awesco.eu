Dr. Roland Schmehl is head of the Airborne Wind Energy research group at Delft University of Technology. Together with Johannes Peschel he cofounded in 2016 the start-up company Kitepower. His research interests are airborne wind energy in general and aeroelasticity of tethered membrane wings and fixed-wing aircraft in particular.

Roland has edited two textbooks about airborne wind energy that were published with Springer in 2013 and 2018. He is coordinator of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Initial Training Network AWESCO and the "Fast Track to Innovation" project REACH, both funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme.
