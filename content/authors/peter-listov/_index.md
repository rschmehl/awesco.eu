Peter Listov is Marie-Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at EPFL, working with Prof. Dr [Colin Jones](/authors/colin-jones/). His research is about [control of periodic orbits](/project/esr14/) for airborne wind energy system, for which he has developed [openKITE](https://github.com/LA-EPFL/openkite), which is an open source [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/) package for simulation, estimation and control of rigid-wing airborne wind energy kites. From October 2013 to January 2016 he was a Lead Research Programmer and a team leader of the Motion Control group at [RoboCV](http://robocv.com/) in Moscow, working on optimal motion planning and control for constrained autonomous guided vehicle. From August 2012 to October 2013, he worked as a Junior Researcher in the company, responsible for development of path planning and trajectory tracking algorithms.
