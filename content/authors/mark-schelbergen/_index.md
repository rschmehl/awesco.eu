Markus Sommerfeld is PhD researcher at the Institute for Integrated Energy Systems (IESVic) of the University of Victoria. He is associated with the doctoral training network AWESCO.

Under the supervision of Dr. Curran Crawford and the support from the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS), Markus' research addresses some of the key challenges of Airborne Wind Energy, with a focus on the assessment of the available wind resource. In his free time Markus enjoys jogging and other outdoor sports to clear his mind, as well as studying Japanese.
