Elena Malz is Marie-Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at Chalmers University of Technology, working with Prof. Dr. [Sebastien Gros](/authors/sebastien-gros). Her research is about [optimal control and simulation of airborne wind energy systems](/project/esr05/). One part of the work is about modeling and optimizing the system in terms of power production. The other part is about computing the annual power production based on real wind data. The power production curve is further analyzed from an electrical energy system perspective with the aim of the eventual integration into a future power system. Fot her graduation project at Aalborg University she assessed the [controller interaction between a full-scale converter wind turbine and a MMC-HVDC transmission system](https://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/files/213543010/Controller_Interaction_Assessment_between_a_Full_scale_Converter_Wind_Turbine_and_a_MMC_HVDC_Transmission_System.pdf). During her studies at the University of Stuttgart she investigated the optimization of off‐shore wind power plants collection grids.
