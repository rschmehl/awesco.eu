Elena Malz is Marie-Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellow and PhD candidate working on optimal control and simulation of airborne wind energy systems. One part of the work is focussed on modeling and optimizing the system in terms of power production. The other part is focussed on computing the annual power production based on real wind data. The power production curve is further analyzed from an electrical energy system perspective with the aim of the eventual integration into a future power system.
