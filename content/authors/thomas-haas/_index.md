Thomas Haas is Marie-Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellow at KU Leuven, working with Prof. dr.ir. [Johan Meyers](/authors/johan-meyers/). His research is focused on [computational simulation of atmospheric flows](/project/esr06/)  and the effect of airborne wind energy systems on these flows. He has published an extensive [wind field dataset](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1418676) for use in airborne wind energy research.
