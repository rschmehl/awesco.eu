Joseph Coleman worked as postdoctoral researcher at the Mobile & Marine Robotics Research Centre of the University of Limerick. His research was focused on autonomous & semi-autonomous vehicles, systems & controls development for harsh field applications, such as airborne, subsea & industrial vehicles. He finalized his PhD research in 2014 about a [distributed control system and novel power take off method for pumping-mode airborne wind energy](http://hdl.handle.net/10344/4424). Since May 2019 he is working as Autonomous Systems Project Manager at [Combilift](https://combilift.com/en/).
