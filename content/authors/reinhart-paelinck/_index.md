Reinhart Paelinck started to investigate airborne wind energy for his [graduation project](https://cdn.syscop.de/publications/Paelinck2010.pdf) at the Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen. After having worked for [Flysurfer Kiteboarding](https://flysurfer.com/) Research & Development, Reinhart founded Kiteswarms Ltd in the UK, developing a multi-drone airborne wind energy system. The German branch of the company, Kiteswarms GmbH, is closely collaborating with the research group of [Moritz Diehl](/authors/moritz-diehl/) at the University of Freiburg.
