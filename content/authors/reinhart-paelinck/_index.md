Reinhart Paelinck is CEO, Co-Founder and Head of Product Development at Kiteswarms Ltd and Kiteswarms GmbH, developing a multi-drone AWE system. The German branch of the company, Kiteswarms GmbH, is closely collaborating with the research group of [Moritz Diehl](/authors/moritz-diehl/) at the University of Freiburg. Prior to the founding of the company in April 2017 he was working for [Flysurfer Kiteboarding](https://flysurfer.com) where he was responsible for several development projects, such as unconventional wing designs and control- and safety systems. One of the development highlights was the [PEAK2](https://vimeo.com/114281542) single skin kite. He co-organized the [3rd Airborne Wind Energy Conference (AWEC) 2011](http://www.awec2011.com/) in Leuven and co-edited the [book of abstracts](https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:54a23dff-74f9-4007-b1d6-e92e0c458491). He presented airborne wind energy at the [TEDxFlanders 2011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95jUGS9Ic-w). He investigated airborne wind energy for his [graduation project](https://cdn.syscop.de/publications/Paelinck2010.pdf) at the Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen.
