Christoph M. Hackl was born in 1977 in Mannheim, Germany. After studying
Electrical Engineering (with focus on controls and mechatronics) at Technical
University of Munich (TUM), Germany and University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA,
he received the B.Sc., Dipl.-Ing., and Dr.-Ing. (Ph.D.) degrees in Electrical Engineering
in 2003, 2004 and 2012, respectively, from TUM.

Since 2004, he has been teaching
electrical drives, power electronics, and mechatronic & renewable energy systems. Since 2014, he has been the head of the research group "Control of Renewable Energy Systems (CRES)" at TUM.
In 2018, he became a Professor for Electrical Machines and Drives and the head of the "Laboratory for Mechatronic and Renewable Energy Systems (LMRES)" at the Munich University of Applied Sciences (MUAS), Germany. His research interests include nonlinear, adaptive and optimal control of electrical, mechatronic and renewable energy systems.

He is IEEE Senior Member.
