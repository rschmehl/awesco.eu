  abstract = {We present a computational fluid dynamic analysis of boundary layer transition on leading edge inflatable kite airfoils used for airborne wind energy generation. Because of the operation in pumping cycles, the airfoil is generally subject to a wide range of Reynolds numbers. The analysis is based on the combination of the shear stress transport turbulence model with the $\\gamma-\rm{\\widetilde{R}e}_{\\theta t}$ transition model, which can handle the laminar boundary layer and its transition to turbulence. The implementation of both models in OpenFOAM is described. We show a validation of the method for a sailwing (ie, a wing with a membrane) airfoil and an application to a leading edge inflatable kite airfoil. For the sailwing airfoil, the results computed with transition model agree well with the existing low Reynolds number experiment over the whole range of angles of attack. For the leading edge inflatable kite airfoil, the transition modeling has both favorable and unfavorable effects on the aerodynamics. On the one hand, the aerodynamics suffer from the laminar separation. But, on the other hand, the laminar boundary layer thickens slower than the turbulent counterpart, which, in combination with transition, delays the separation. The results also indicate that the aerodynamics of the kite airfoil could be improved by delaying the boundary layer transition during the traction phase and tripping the transition in the retraction phase.},

  abstract = {Airborne wind energy (AWE) systems possess theoretically a strong potential as an efficient cost-effective replacement for conventional wind turbines (CWTs). However, several highly correlated design, operational and engineering aspects; hinder the commercialization of such technology. One of those challenges, from an electrical perspective, is the selection of an efficient fault-tolerant electrical drive. The ongoing trend of employing three-phase drives as those for CWTs is non-optimal; since statistics revealed that failure rates of power electronic converters, their connections to the machine terminal and stator windings represent the highest failure rates among the CWT components. When safety measures are embraced, the faulty part is disconnected leading to a single phase operation, which jeopardizes the airborne membrane and eventually a complete failure of the AWE system. A suitable alternative is power-segmentation of the machine by rewinding to a dual three-phase (DT) machine, ensuring reliable continuous operation owing to their inherent fault-tolerant capability. This thesis proposes the utilization of DT interior permanent magnet synchronous machines. Compared to the available body of literature, the main contributions of the carried-out work are: (i) identifying the machine non-linearities; (ii) modeling and simulating the machine dynamics; (iii) efficient
operation coupled with a zero steady-state error current regulator; and (iv) deriving a post-fault optimization without exceeding the machine ratings (i.e. currents and voltages). Experimental results are provided for the sake of validation.},

  title    = {Identification and optimization of an airborne wind energy system},
  school   = {University of Freiburg},

  abstract = {Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) refers to systems capable of harvesting energy from the wind by flying crosswind patterns with tethered airfoils. This thesis focuses on a specific technology called pumping mode AWE. We consider as a case study the real plant developed by the Dutch company Ampyx Power B.V., where the airborne component is a high lift rigid wing autonomous aircraft designed for an extremely challenging operational environment. The techniques developed within this manuscript rely on mathematical models described in state-space representation. As a consequence, the first part of the manuscript introduces a suitable mathematical representation of the case study for identification and optimization purposes. Normally, the system identification procedure of aircraft deployed for AWE is ultimately addressed via an intensive flight test campaign in order to gain additional insight about the aerodynamic properties. For that purpose, we provide a comprehensive guideline on how to reliably identify the aerodynamic models via flight tests. More precisely, we focus on the flight test operations procedure, signal input design and parameter estimation algorithm. Additionally, we show how to optimize system identification flight tests by solving a time domain model-based optimum experimental design problem. In an AWE system, the airfoil is required to fly in cyclic patterns to maximize net power produced per cycle. Due to the numerous variables that need to be taken into account simultaneously, the computation of efficient and feasible flight trajectories is not trivial. We show how to systematically obtain such flight trajectories via an optimal control approach. Several scenarios are analyzed in terms of control strategy, average power output, and trajectory topology. Finally, we show how many tasks relative to the scaling up of such systems can be significantly facilitated by means of the optimization algorithm developed within this work.},
