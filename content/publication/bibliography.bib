  abstract = {In this work, a novel vertical takeoff and landing methodology for flexible wing kite power systems is presented. Starting from a basic mast-based launching and landing concept, the operational envelope will be enlarged using the external assistance of a multicopter. The multicopter is used to drag the kite along a specified launching path until the operational altitude is reached, where the kite is detached and steered to its characteristic parking position while the multicopter lands. The landing of the kite will be conducted without multicopter assistance, and solely the winch will be used to pull the kite toward the ground station. For all maneuvers, flight control algorithms are presented, and the feasibility of the proposed methodology is analyzed using a developed simulation environment incorporating models for the kite, multicopter, ground station, and the tethers that connect the individual subsystems.},

  abstract  = {Airborne  wind  energy  (AWE)  is  a  concept  for  harvesting  wind  energy  using  tethered  flying  devices.  Compared  toconventional wind turbines AWE systems require substantially less support structures like a tower.  The replacementof towers by tethers also allow accessing higher altitudes where winds blow stronger and more persistent.  Severalconfigurations are currently pursued.  Electricity can be generated with on-board propellers which are driven by the airflow and the power is transmitted to the ground through a conducting tether. Another configuration is the pumping cyclein which case the kite flies crosswind to pull a tether that is unreeled as it moves a ground-based electrical generator, anda retraction phase when the kite is reeled in. Next to electricity generation AWE can also be used for ship propulsion. We consider a single cell of a ram-air wing in our study which is based on an inflatable double skin design.  Ram-air wings are inflated by the stagnation pressure entering through inlets at the leading edge. The internalpressure provides structural stability and stiffness.  The fully or partially inflated structure is flexible and can thereforeexhibit large deformations during flight.  This introduces a strong coupling between the structure and the air flow sincethe internal pressure in dependent on the wind speed, and a deformed kite will inevitably have a different pressure fieldcaused by the flow compared to an un-deformed kite. Also, bridle system induces a significant additional drag to the wingdrag and therefore the kites fly with high angle of attack to obtain high lift and to ultimately maximise power output. Highangles of attack causes the flow to separate which cannot be simulated with fast inviscid methods and therefore a CFDanalysis tool such as OpenFOAM is required.The main challenge in analysis and design of these kites is the governing fluid-structure interaction (FSI) mechanism,which leads to a drastic increase in model complexity. On the other hand utilising FSI is crucial to obtain reliable results. on  performance  measures  and  structural  integrity.   We  follow  the  partitioned  coupling  approach,  where  the  fluid  andstructure domains are solved individually and coupled at their interface. In this work we couple OpenFOAM with ourfinite element (FE) solver mem4pyby using the coupling tool preCICE. The coupled solver is then used to simulate asingle ram-air wing section (cell) and its change in aerodynamic performance due to deformation.},

  abstract  = {Multiple-kite airborne wind energy (AWE) systems are typically characterized by unstable and highly non-linear dynamics which often translates to intricate controller design and challenging coordination problems. Rotary kite AWE systems (RAWES) have been alternatively proposed for small-scale applications, under the assumption that they can reduce the complexity of the control problem. This paper confirms that a small, rigid-wing RAWES in pumping mode can be controlled effectively in a large operational range, using only pitch control as on-board actuation. Optimal control is applied to compute RAWES pumping trajectories in different operating regions, for a design geometry that is optimized for a rated wind speed under structural constraints. The reduced control complexity comes at the cost of a low harvesting factor, close to that of conventional wind turbines.},

A characteristic feature of the various conversion concepts discussed is the use of tethered flying devices to substantially reduce the material consumption per installed unit and to access wind energy at higher altitudes, where the wind is more consistent.
The introductory chapter describes the emergence and economic dimension of airborne wind energy. Focusing on "Fundamentals, Modeling & Simulation", Part I includes six contributions that describe quasi-steady as well as dynamic models and simulations of airborne wind energy systems or individual components. Shifting the spotlight to "Control, Optimization & Flight State Measurement", Part II combines one chapter on measurement techniques with five chapters on control of kite and ground stations, and two chapters on optimization. Part III on "Concept Design & Analysis" includes three chapters that present and analyze novel harvesting concepts as well as two chapters on system component design. Part IV, which centers on "Implemented Concepts", presents five chapters on established system concepts and one chapter about a subsystem for automatic launching and landing of kites. In closing, Part V focuses with four chapters on "Technology Deployment" related to market and financing strategies, as well as on regulation and the environment.
The book builds on the success of the first volume "Airborne Wind Energy" ([Springer, 2013](http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39965-7)), and offers a self-contained reference guide for researchers, scientists, professionals and students. The respective chapters were contributed by a broad variety of authors: academics, practicing engineers and inventors, all of whom are experts in their respective fields.},

In this paper we compute the region of attraction (ROA) of path-stabilizing feedback gains around a periodic trajectory as typically flown by a power generating kite. The feedback gains are obtained from applying a time-varying periodic Linear Quadratic Regulator to the system expressed in transversal coordinates. To compute the ROA we formulate Lyapunov stability conditions which we verify by Sum-of-Squares programs. These programs are posed as an optimization problem for which we compare various definitions of the cost function representing the size of the ROA. In a numeric case study we demonstrate that the maximization of an expanding ellipse inside of quartic Lyapunov functions leads to significantly larger verified ROAs compared to the standard approach of optimizing over the scaling of the sublevel set of a quadratic Lyapunov function.},

The method consists of an optimization problem in which transverse contraction conditions are verified via sum-of-squares programs. The optimization approach can be used either to maximize the bounds on the allowable parameter uncertainty or to maximize the size of the region of contraction (ROC) given a fixed level of uncertainty. In a case study we apply the procedure to an Airborne Wind Energy system where the flight path of a power generating kite is controlled by a linear quadratic regulator based on a model which is prone to large parametric uncertainties. We consider periodic trajectories of the stabilized kite system and transform the dynamics into transversal coordinates for simplification of the controller design and reduction of the computational cost. The numerical results of the proposed optimization show that uncertainty in the steering gain parameter decreases the size of the ROC while uncertainty in wind speed or line length within the considered range of operating conditions does not affect the size of the robust ROC.},

The prediction horizon is split into two sections and the constraints associated with the terminal one are tightened using a barrier formulation. In this way, when using the Real-Time Iteration scheme, variables associated with such stages can be efficiently eliminated from the quadratic subproblems by a single backward Riccati sweep. After eliminating the tightened stages, a quadratic problem with a reduced horizon is solved where the original constraints are used. The solution is then expanded to the full horizon with a single forward Riccati sweep. By doing so, the online computational burden associated with the solution of the optimization problems can be largely reduced. Numerical results are reported where, using the proposed scheme, a speedup of about one order of magnitude can be achieved without compromising closed-loop performance.},

Due to the limited computational power of the available hardware, a modified interior-point solver for the so-called partially tightened Real-Time Iteration is used. The algorithm splits the prediction horizon in two sections. A Riccati-like recursion is exploited that relies on a single linearization of the complementarity conditions per sampling-time for the terminal section. In this way, it is possible to achieve a speedup of a factor 3 with respect to a standard real-time iteration formulation for the application under consideration. Simulation results that show the improvement in performance obtained by using NMPC over standard control techniques are discussed and experimental results using the proposed implementation are presented.},

  abstract = {Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines for Embedded Optimization (BLASFEO) is a dense linear algebra library providing high-performance implementations of BLAS- and LAPACK-like routines for use in embedded optimization and small-scale high-performance computing, in general. A key difference with respect to existing high-performance implementations of BLAS is that the computational performance is optimized for small- to medium-scale matrices, i.e., for sizes up to a few hundred. BLASFEO comes with three different implementations: a high-performance implementation aimed at providing the highest performance for matrices fitting in cache, a reference implementation providing portability and embeddability and optimized for very small matrices, and a wrapper to standard BLAS and LAPACK providing high performance on large matrices. The three implementations of BLASFEO together provide high-performance dense linear algebra routines for matrices ranging from very small to large. Compared to both open-source and proprietary highly tuned BLAS libraries, for matrices of size up to about 100, the high-performance implementation of BLASFEO is about 20--30% faster than the corresponding level 3 BLAS routines and two to three times faster than the corresponding LAPACK routines.},

The aim of this paper is to summarize the main algorithmic advances in the field and to provide a consistent benchmark between a selection of software tools that have been recently developed.

Newton-type optimization relies on a numerical simulation method in addition to the propagation of first or higher order derivatives. In the case of stiff or implicitly defined dynamics, implicit integration schemes are typically preferred. This paper proposes a tailored implementation of the necessary linear algebra routines (LU factorization and triangular solutions), in order to allow for a considerable computational speedup of such integrators. In particular, the open-source BLASFEO framework is presented as a library of efficient linear algebra routines for small to medium-scale embedded optimization applications. Its performance is illustrated on the nonlinear optimal control example of a chain of masses. The proposed library allows for considerable speedups and it is found to be overall competitive with both a code-generated solver and a high-performance BLAS implementation.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an extension of the simulation code ASWING to aeroelastic analysis of an airborne wind turbine. The device considered in this study consists of a tethered rigid wing with onboard-mounted wind turbines designed for wind energy harvesting in crosswind flight operation. The electrically conducting tether is deployed from a ground station and represented as a linear elastic spring with stiffness, mass, and frontal area emulating the properties of the real tether. The tether splits into several bridle lines to distribute the load transfer from the wing and to some degree also constrain its roll motion. The comparatively short bridle lines are considered to be inelastic with insignificant mass and aerodynamic drag contributions. The simulation model is validated by wind tunnel tests of a simplified scale model of the bridled wing. The comparison of computed and measured dynamic aeroelastic response shows that the tether force and the geometry of the bridle line system can strongly influence the flutter speed of the wing. In a final step, the simulation model is used to analyze the divergence, control reversal and effectiveness, and flutter behavior of a next-generation large-scale airborne wind turbine. The results confirm the significant influence of the geometry of the bridle line system on static and dynamic aeroelastic phenomena. It is concluded that classical methods used for suppression of aeroelastic instabilities can be applied to bridled wings only if this influence is taken into account.},

  abstract = {Wind tunnel testing of large deformable soft kites for wind energy conversion is expensive and in many cases practically not feasible. Computational simulation of the coupled fluid–structure interaction problem is scientifically challenging and of limited practical use for aerodynamic characterization. In this paper we present a novel experimental method for aerodynamic characterization of flexible membrane kites by in situ measurement of the relative flow, while performing complex flight maneuvers. We find that the measured aerodynamic coefficients agree well with the values that are currently used for flight simulation of soft kites. For flight operation in crosswind maneuvers during which the traction force is kept constant, the angle of attack is inversely related to the relative flow velocity. For entire pumping cycles, the measurements show considerable variations in the aerodynamic coefficients, while the angle of attack of the kite varies only in a narrow range. This finding questions the commonly used representation of aerodynamic coefficients as sole functions of the angle of attack and stresses the importance of aeroelastic deformation for this type of wing. Considering the effect of the power setting (identical to the trim) solely as a rigid-body pitch rotation does not adequately describe the aero-structural behavior of the kite. We show that the aerodynamic coefficients vary as functions of the power setting (trim) of the kite, the steering commands and the flight direction.},

Ground generation systems use the pulling force of a kite to generate a linear traction motion driving a drum connected to a generator. To understand and quantify the aerodynamic performance of a soft kite we developed a sensor system that measures the relative flow conditions on a flying, highly flexible wing. Together with ground-based measurements of traction force, the aerodynamic efficiency of the kite can be computed. The experimental data can be used for the validation of currently available kite models.
The lift-to-drag ratio is mainly affected by the power setting or trim of the kite and the steering commands. For the first time the effect of the trim control on the kite's steering capability was quantified for a leading edge inflatable kite. We found that a trim position with higher power ratio which results in a higher angle of attack increases the steering agility of the kite. The attained yaw rate increased by 40%. For optimization of future power kites it is important to understand the mechanisms affecting a kite's performance.},

Even though the physical foundations of the various conversion concepts are well understood, the actual economic potential of distributed small-scale and centralized large-scale power generation under realworld conditions is still under investigation. In the present chapter we consider the clustering of units into a large kite wind park, specifically the spatial arrangement and collective operation. The analysis starts from a quasi-steady flight model of the kite to estimate the power production in pumping cycle operation. From the surface area and aerodynamic properties of the kite all other system parameters are determined. A genetic algorithm is used to optimize the operation of a single unit and to derive its power curve. Based on this information multiple interconnected units are simulated and an economic model is added. The results show that a coordinated collective operation not only achieves a continuous net electricity output, but also decreases the LCOE from 106 to 96 €/Mwh as consequence of economic scale effects. The prediction supports the substantial economic potential of pumping kite wind parks for large-scale power generation.},

This chapter extends a dynamic system model to account for a realistic, turbulent wind environment and adds a flight path planner using a sequence of attractor points and turn actions. Path coordinates are calculated with explicit geometric formulas. To optimize the power output the path is adapted to the average wind speed and the vertical wind profile, using a small set of parameters. The planner employs a finite state machine with switch conditions that are highly robust towards sensor errors. The results indicate, that the decline of the average power output of pumping kite power systems at high wind speeds can be mitigated. In addition it is shown, that reeling out towards the zenith after flying figure eight flight maneuvers significantly reduces the traction forces during reel-in and thus increases the total efficiency.},

Neither at national nor at international level there is yet a common view on regulation. In this chapter, we investigate the role of airborne wind energy systems in the airspace and possible aviation-related risks. Within this scope, current operation permit details for several prototypes are presented. Even though these prototypes operate with local permits, the commercial end-products are expected to fully comply with international airspace regulations. We share the insights obtained by Ampyx Power as one of the early movers in this area. Current and expected international airspace regulations are reviewed that can be used to find a starting point to evidence the safety of airborne wind energy systems.

This hypothesis was confirmed based on a kite power system model extended from Loyd's model. The performance of small-scale and utility-scale kites in monoplane and biplane configurations were examined for increasing lift coefficients. Moreover, several parameters of the utility-scale system were optimized with a genetic algorithm. With an optimal lift coefficient of 4.5, the biplane outperformed the monoplane. A 40 m wing span kite was expected to achieve a rated power of about 4.1 MW with a power density of about 52 kW/m2. A parameter sensitivity analysis of the optimized design was performed. Moreover, to demonstrate the feasibility of very high lift coefficients and the validity of a utilized simplified airfoil polar model, CFDs of a proposed high-lift multi-element airfoil were performed and the airfoil polars were recorded. Finally, a planform design of a biplane kite was proposed.},

Two PI controller designs are discussed: the classical PI controller with constant parameters and a nonlinear PI controller with online parameter adjustment. Based on a worst-case analysis of the physical properties, bounds on the constant parameters of the classical PI controller are derived leading to a conservative design to assure a stable operation also during the reel-in phase where the system dynamics are non-minimum phase. To overcome these limitations in the closed-loop bandwidth, a nonlinear PI controller is proposed which adjusts its parameters online. For controller design, the linearized system model is used and the controller parameters are computed via "online pole placement". Simulation results illustrate robustness, stability and improved control performance of the proposed nonlinear PI controller in comparison to the classical PI controller.},

  abstract = {Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) is a promising new technology, and attracts a growing academic and industrial attention. Important research efforts have been deployed to develop prototypes in order to test the technology, generate control algorithms and optimize the efficiency of AWE systems. By today, a large set of control and optimization methods is available for AWE systems. However, because no validated reference model is available, there is a lack of benchmark for these methods. In this paper, we provide a reference model for pumping mode AWE systems based on rigid wings. The model describes the flight dynamics of a tethered 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) rigid body aircraft in form of differential-algebraic equations, based on Lagrange dynamics. With the help of least squares fitting the model is assessed using real flight data from the Ampyx Power prototype AP2. The model equations are smooth and have a low symbolic complexity, so as to make the model ideal for optimization and control. The information given in this paper aims at providing AWE researchers with a model that has been validated against flight data and that is well suited for trajectory and power output simulation and optimization.},

  abstract  = {Airborne wind energy (AWE) is a promising source of renewable energy, with a potential of offering great and reliable energy yields. However, in addition to the usual power intermittency of renewable source of energies, AWE systems have a large and periodic fluctuation of their power output, and even consume power at certain phases of their orbit in some modes of power generation. These fluctuations may become a significant obstacle to a large-scale deployment of AWE systems in the power grid. For a large AWE farm, these fluctuations can be mitigated by power averaging, at the expense of fixing the AWE systems orbit times. This requirement removes the possibility for individual AWE systems within a wind farm to optimize their orbit time for their specific, local wind conditions, entailing a loss of performance. In order to assess the viability of mitigating the power fluctuation by power averaging at the wind farm level, this paper quantifies the loss of performance it yields.},

  abstract  = {Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) is an emerging technology in the field of renewable energy that uses kites to harvest wind energy. However, unlike for conventional wind turbines, the wind environment in AWE systems has not yet been studied in much detail. We propose a simulation framework using Large Eddy Simulation to model the wakes of such kite systems and offer a comparison with turbine-like wakes. In order to model the kite effects on the flow, a lifting line technique is used. We investigate different wake configurations related to the operation modes of wind turbines and airborne systems in drag mode. In the turbine mode, the aerodynamic torque of the blades is directly added to the flow. In the kite drag mode, the aerodynamic torque of the wings is directly balanced by an opposite torque induced by on-board generators; this results in a total torque on the flow that is zero. We present the main differences in wake characteristics, especially flow induction and vorticity fields, for the depicted operation modes both with laminar and turbulent inflows.},

  abstract = {Kite power is a novel way of producing wind energy. One possible implementation uses the traction force of a fast-flying kite to drive a stationary generator on the ground. This concept aims at reducing the cost of energy produced by conventional wind turbines. There are however several technical challenges to overcome to develop kite power technology on a large scale. One of them arises from the light weight and flexible nature of the inflatable kite. This yields a tight coupling between the kite's aero- and structural-dynamics, which is particularly critical when launching and retrieving the system. Computer models capable of predicting these interactions are at an early stage of development. This paper presents the grounds of an ongoing research project, which aims at computationally modelling fluid--structure interactions for kite power systems .},

The analytical solutions allow for an (almost) instantaneous selection and computation of actual operation strategy and corresponding reference currents. Numerical methods (approximating these solutions only) are no longer required. The unified theory is based on one simple idea: all optimisation problems, their respective constraints and the computation of the intersection point(s) of voltage ellipse, current circle or torque, MTPC, MTPV, MTPF hyperbolas are reformulated implicitly as quadrics which allows to invoke the Lagrangian formalism and to find the roots of fourth-order polynomials analytically. The proposed theory is suitable for any anisotropic synchronous machine. Implementation and measurement results illustrate effectiveness and applicability of the theoretical findings in real world.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a computationally efficient Predictive Torque Control (PTC) technique for permanent-magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) without weighting factors. The proposed control strategy is based on computing the q-axis reference current from the demanded torque. Furthermore, the d-axis reference current is set to zero to achieve the maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) operation of the PMSG. Then, the reference voltage vector (VV) is directly computed from the reference current vector using the deadbeat principle. Finally, according to the location of this reference VV, only three evaluations of the cost function are required. The cost function includes only the error between the reference VV and the candidates ones, which eliminates the need of weighting factors. Therefore, the proposed control scheme overcomes the following drawbacks of the classical PTC: 1) High calculation burden, and 2) tuning of the weighting factors. Experimental results using a dSPACE DS1007 realtime platform and a 14.5 kW PMSG are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed control method.},

This requires an accurate electromechanical model with precise electromechanical torque estimation. This paper presents a high fidelity direct-quadrature (dq) model capable of describing the generated electromechanical torque. The presented method is based on obtaining the non-linear flux linkage maps as well as describing the harmonic models, which contribute to the average and ripple torque, respectively. The flux linkage maps contribute in the tuning of the stator current controllers and electromechanical torque computation, which is compared to the computed torque from the manufacturer parameters and literature.

  abstract  = {Space-vector PWM (SVPWM) gained attention, as a voltage synthesis technique for asymmetrical dual three phase machines (ADTMs); due to its ability to minimize the harmonic content of the output and minimize the switching losses through proper selection of the switching vectors. It has been studied extensively for ADTMs mainly for induction machines with isolated neutrals (2N), such that the inverter is assumed to be the only source capable of inducing harmonics within the stator currents. Thus, by setting the xy subspace voltages to zero, the harmonic content is minimized. However, for dual three phase-permanent magnet synchronous machines (DT-PMSM), the presence of non-sinusoidal rotor flux invokes significant harmonics, mandating non-zero references for the xy plane to ensure proper compensation. This paper invokes the employment of non-zero harmonic references within the SVPWM calculation for the 2N connection, as well as laying out the fundamentals for the single neutral (1N) connection, which is more reliable from fault-tolerance point of view. Also, a simple digital realization is presented, suitable for the 12-, 24-sector SVPWM methods, both continuous and discontinuous modulations. The theoretical findings are corroborated with a 4.4 kW DT-PMSM, demonstrating significant improvement in the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the stator currents.},

Then, the location of this reference VV is identified based on its angle. Finally, a certain cost function is evaluated for only three times to get the optimal voltage vector to be applied in the next sampling instant. However, the proposed DMPCC is a model-based control system, and accordingly, sensitive to parameter variations of the PMSG. To mitigate such limitation, a simple observer is designed to enhance the robustness of the proposed DMPCC scheme to variations of the PMSG parameters. The proposed DMPCC strategy has been experimentally implemented and its performance has been compared with that of the conventional DMPCC.},

  abstract = {Direct interconnection is a novel technique for interconnecting offshore airborne wind energy (AWE) generators which facilitates the removal of power converters from the offshore generation site. In this technique, unlike the conventional approach, all generators are interconnected directly and after dispatching the generated power to shore, a back to back converter or several paralleled back to back converters change the generated power to grid-compliant power. Considering that the high expenses of offshore operations for back to back converter repair and maintenance and the higher accessibility of shore-side back to back converters, this technique can improve the reliability and economy of the energy generation system. This research aims to implement and study the practicality and reliability of the direct interconnection approach for offshore non-reversing pumping mode airborne wind energy generator systems. The interaction of direct interconnected AWEs in normal and fault conditions is investigated, and synchronisation, frequency control and load sharing control of the AWE farm are examined and discussed.},

This method is a new approach invented for interconnecting offshore wind turbines with the least number of required offshore-based power electronic converters. The direct interconnection technique can be beneficial in improving the economy and reliability of marine airborne wind energy systems. The performance and interactions of the directly interconnected generators inside the energy farm internal power grid are investigated. The results of the study conducted in this paper, show the directly interconnected AWE systems can exhibit a poor load balance and significant reactive power exchange which must be addressed. Power control strategies for controlling the active and reactive power of the AWE farm are designed, implemented, and promising results are discussed in this paper.},

Within such analysis, it is shown that a non-optimized closed-loop flight control system can generate power to within 10% of the open-loop optimal flight trajectories. Additionally, results demonstrate that the system efficiency does not depend on the trajectory topology, though a significant change in terms of trajectory shape is observed for different wind speeds as a result of trajectory constraints.},

Approaches based on nonlinear optimization, such as moving horizon estimation, have been shown to improve the accuracy of the estimated solution compared to traditional filter techniques. This paper introduces an optimization-based framework for multi-sensor fusion following a moving horizon scheme. The framework is applied to the often occurring estimation problem of motion tracking by fusing measurements of a global navigation satellite system receiver and an inertial measurement unit. The resulting algorithm is used to estimate position, velocity, and orientation of a maneuvering airplane and is evaluated against an accurate reference trajectory. A detailed study of the influence of the horizon length on the quality of the solution is presented and evaluated against filter-like and batch solutions of the problem. The versatile configuration possibilities of the framework are finally used to analyze the estimated solutions at different evaluation times exposing a nearly linear behavior of the sensor fusion problem.},

Over-parametrizations such as unit quaternions are commonly used to avoid singularities but come with the property of an invariant which needs to be preserved. By using numerical optimization methods, these invariants are subject to numeric errors and require stabilization. In this work, we adopt methods known from optimal control for the problem of state estimation. We present an optimization-based attitude estimator using the measurements of an inertial measurement unit and evaluate the performance of a first-order stabilization of the invariant by modifying the dynamics. The uncertainties of the estimator are analyzed for different configurations of the proposed stabilization. Finally, we show how the stabilization affects the estimation of parameters and justify the use of an additional equality constraint for the invariant to yield more robust and consistent results.},

  abstract  = {The handling of 3D orientations is a common element in many problems that arise in the estimation and control of dynamic systems. Over-parametrizations such as unit quaternions are commonly used to avoid singularities but come with the property of an invariant which needs to be preserved. By using numerical optimization methods, these invariants are subject to numeric errors and require stabilization. In this work, we adopt methods known from optimal control for the problem of state estimation. We present an optimization-based attitude estimator using the measurements of an inertial measurement unit and evaluate the performance of a first-order stabilization of the invariant by modifying the dynamics. The uncertainties of the estimator are analyzed for different configurations of the proposed stabilization. Finally, we show how the stabilization affects the estimation of parameters and justify the use of an additional equality constraint for the invariant to yield more robust and consistent results.},

  abstract  = {Inertial sensors are used in an increasing number of autonomous applications. Integrating such sensors into dynamic systems, the problem of their calibration arises naturally. Existing methods often require the sensor to be accurately placed in certain poses, which can be infeasible in practice. In this paper, we present an optimization-based estimator for in-field identification of inertial biases and scale factors. Instead of predefined poses, we use measurements of an accurate global navigation satellite system receiver in the calibration algorithm. By adopting a moving horizon scheme, the resulting estimator has the potential to run on embedded hardware allowing for online calibration without sacrificing robustness. We also present an approach for the simulation of realistic sensor data. The resulting datasets are used to analyze the performance of the optimization-based estimator. The evaluated statistics clearly show that moving horizon estimation improves the robustness and accuracy of the presented calibration approach in the presence of uncertain initial conditions and outperforms traditional recursive filters.},

A fast but detailed model of the pumping airborne wind energy system is used to calculate a family of power curves at different fixed altitudes. Based on these power curves a yield estimation method is presented which also considers power losses due to ice accretion, insufficient conditions for take-off and low visibility situations.

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an aero‐structural model of a tethered swept wing for airborne wind energy generation. The carbon composite wing has neither fuselage nor actuated aerodynamic control surfaces and is controlled entirely from the ground using three separate tethers. The computational model is efficient enough to be used for weight optimisation at the initial design stage. The main load‐bearing wing component is a nontypical “D”‐shaped wing‐box, which is represented as a slender carbon composite shell and further idealised as a stack of two‐dimensional cross section models arranged along an anisotropic one‐dimensional beam model. This reduced 2+1D finite element model is then combined with a nonlinear vortex step method that determines the aerodynamic load. A bridle model is utilised to calculate the individual forces as a function of the aerodynamic load in the bridle lines that connect the main tether to the wing. The entire computational model is used to explore the influence of the bride on the D‐box structure. Considering a reference D‐box design along with a reference aerodynamic load case, the structural response is analysed for typical bridle configurations. Subsequently, an optimisation of the internal geometry and laminate fibre orientations is carried out using the structural computation models, for a fixed aerodynamic and bridle configuration. Aiming at a minimal weight of the wing structure, we find that for the typical load case of the system, an overall weight savings of approximately 20% can be achieved compared with the initial reference design.},

One particularly challenging aspect is the control of the kite, or similarly a tethered fixed-wing vehicle. Tethered flight is a highly nonlinear, constrained, and fast dynamic system, requiring careful control design for optimal power producing results. This paper formulates the AWE problem as a practical, high-level Nonlinear Model Predictive Control scheme, balancing an abstracted control augmented modeling approach with the tight computational constraints on board small fixed-wing systems for real-time, long-horizon predictive control. A power objective is developed which trades off tracking performance of a given nominal path with the expected power generation resulting from the aircraft's trajectory. An analysis of the performance gains in various wind conditions are elaborated per tuning of the power objective, and the controller is validated in simulation before deployment on a small development platform. The control system is demonstrated in practice in an exemplary tethered flight experiment.},

  abstract = {Summary Engineers and researchers working on the development of airborne wind energy systems (AWES) still rely on oversimplified wind speed approximations and coarsely sampled reanalysis data because of a lack of high-resolution wind data at altitudes above 200 m. Ten-minute average wind speed LiDAR measurements up to an altitude of 1100 m and data from nearby weather stations were investigated with regard to wind energy generation and impact on LiDAR measurements. Data were gathered by a long-range pulsed Doppler LiDAR device installed on flat terrain. Because of the low overall carrier-to-noise ratio, a custom-filtering technique was applied. Our analyses show that diurnal variation and atmospheric stability significantly affect wind conditions aloft which cause a wide range of wind speeds and a multimodal probability distribution that cannot be represented by a simple Weibull distribution fit. A better representation of the actual wind conditions can be achieved by fitting Weibull distributions separately to stable and unstable conditions. Splitting and clustering the data by simulated surface heat flux reveals substate stratification responsible for the multimodality. We classify different wind conditions based on these substates, which result in different wind energy potential. We assess optimal traction power and optimal operating altitudes statistically as well as for specific days based on a simplified AWES model. Using measured wind speed standard deviation, we estimate average turbulence intensity and show its variation with altitude and time. Selected short-term data sets illustrate temporal changes in wind conditions and atmospheric stratification with a high temporal and vertical resolution.},

Wind LiDAR measurements and mesoscale models both have their advantages and disadvantages when assessing the wind resource at such heights. This article investigates whether assimilating measurements into the mesoscale WRF model using observation nudging generates a more accurate, complete data set. The impact of continuous observation nudging at multiple altitudes on simulated wind conditions is compared to an unnudged reference run and to the LiDAR measurements themselves. We compare the impact on wind speed and direction for individual days, average diurnal variability and long term statistics. Finally, wind speed data is used to estimate optimal traction power and operating altitudes of AWES. Observation nudging improves the overall accuracy of WRF. Close to the surface the impact of nudging is limited as effects of the air-surface interaction dominate, but becomes more prominent at mid-altitudes and decreases towards high altitudes. The wind speed probability distribution shows a multi-modality caused by changing atmospheric stability conditions. Based on a simplified AWES model the most probable optimal altitude will be around 400 m. Such systems will benefit from dynamically adjusting their operating altitude.},

The test procedure is based on repeatable automated maneuvers with the entire kite system under realistic conditions. By measuring line forces and line angles, we determine the aerodynamic coefficients and lift-to-drag ratio as functions of the length ratio between power and steering lines. This nondimensional parameter characterizes the angle of attack of the wing and is varied automatically by the control unit on the towed test bench. During each towing run, several test cycles are executed such that mean values can be determined and errors can be minimized. We can conclude from this study that an objective measurement of specific dynamic properties of highly flexible membrane wings is feasible. The presented tow test method is suitable for quantitatively assessing and comparing different wing designs. The method represents an essential milestone for the development and characterization of tethered membrane wings as well as for the validation and improvement of simulation models. On the basis of this work, more complex maneuvers and a full degree of automation can be implemented in subsequent work. It can also be used for aerodynamic parameter identification.},

They can extract more energy from high altitude wind currents compared to conventional wind turbines. This can be achieved with the aid of aerodynamic lift generated by a wing tethered to the ground. Significant savings in investment costs and overall system mass would be obtained since no tower is required. To solve the problems of wind speed uncertainty and kite deflections throughout the flight, system identification is required. Consequently, the kite governing equations can be accurately described. In this work, a simple model was presented for a tether with a fixed length and compared to another model for parameter estimation. In addition, for the purpose of stabilizing the system, fuzzy control was also applied. The design of the controller was based on the concept of Mamdani. Due to its robustness, fuzzy control can cover a wider range of different wind conditions compared to the classical controller. Finally, system identification was compared to the simple model at various wind speeds, which helps to tune the fuzzy control parameters.},

  abstract  = {Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWESs) are an emerging alternative to conventional wind turbines that harvest wind energy via tethered aircraft at altitudes unreachable to current wind energy technologies. Long-term, high resolution wind data is necessary to optimize the flight path and power production, design and size the aircraft, and ultimately estimate levelized cost of energy. Measurements at these altitudes are expensive, time-consuming and their data availability is constraint by measuring technique. In my research I combine LiDAR measurements, mesoscale simulations (WRF) and high resolution LES (PALM) to produce a high altitude inflow model covering a wide range of the wind spectrum. Initial and boundary conditions of the mesoscale model are nudged by LiDAR to increase precision. Results of this simulation drive the LES which inform on high frequency turbulent fluctuations and cross/autocorrelations. Wind velocity profiles and turbulence intensity significantly vary with time of day. Therefore, AWES will benefit from dynamically adapting their flight pattern and operational height to the prevailing wind situations to reduce systemic losses such as tether drag, tether weight and misalignment with the wind direction. Furthermore, atmospheric stability significantly affects wind conditions which cause a wide range of wind speeds and can result in a multimodal probability distribution at higher altitudes, which cannot be represented by a simple Weibull distribution fit. A better representation of the wind statistics improves load and power estimation.},

Despite advances in (Reynolds-averaged) Navier–Stokes equations solvers and models, it is arguably the first choice for preliminary and even detailed design. A new method of coupling the boundary-layer equations to the inviscid flow is presented. The boundary-layer equations are solved with given displacement thickness, and a Newton method couples the viscous and inviscid regimes. This leads to a significant decrease in computational effort as compared to a joint solution of the boundary-layer equations with the coupling problem. The software Viiflow uses this mechanism, and examples that couple the integral boundary-layer equations with a panel method are presented: assessing accuracy using wind-tunnel measurements, using the software for a fluid–structure interaction problem, and a runtime performance comparison demonstrating a significant improvement as compared to the popular viscous–inviscid interaction airfoil analysis software XFOIL for higher numbers of panels.},

However, in this chapter it is shown that tethering the kite to the top of a tower instead of to the ground can have advantages: Most notably, the ``cosine loss'' is reduced, i.e. the misalignment of the wind velocity vector and the direction of the traction power transfer. Hence, a tower can increase the power and energy yield up to about the double. Even for small tower heights compared to the kite's operation altitude, a significant efficiency increase can be obtained. Further advantages of a tower are highlighted e.g. for the autonomous start and landing and for the wind velocity measurement. Possible tower concepts are illustrated.},

The drag power kite plant model is based on a point-mass model and a simple aerodynamics model with various drag contributions. Simulations are conducted with the parameters of the 20 kW Wing 7 developed by Makani Power, Inc. The proper working of the control scheme is indicated by the good match of the simulation results with independent simulation results and measurements published by Makani. A temporary overloading of the powertrain with about twice the nominal power can be concluded as a requirement; otherwise the mean power would be significantly lower. Because of the reduction of the lift and thus reduction of the centripetal force at high wind speeds, the inside-down figure eight can be concluded as the best pattern.},

  abstract       = {An approach for a fault-tolerant power electronic system for drag power kites is proposed. The key idea is to use a high number of electrical cables in the tether and leave rotor drivetrains in groups isolated on the kite, in the tether, and on the ground. The power flow is paralleled behind an uninterruptible power supply of each drivetrain group on the ground. It is shown that this approach hardly affects the overall system performance, for example, due to the anyways high optimal number of electrical cables in the tether. With this approach, a fault in one drivetrain group does only affect the same drivetrain group and a fault between two drivetrain groups affects only the same two drivetrain groups. A fuse system and a fault shut-off control for the power converters are proposed, with which also faults between two drivetrain groups lead at most to unavailability of only one drivetrain group. In particular also open circuit faults and short circuit faults in the tether are mitigated and are overall not harmful for the system and a usual multicopter-like landing is still possible. Therefore, the proposed power electronic system design has no single point of failure. A generalization and a number of variants are discussed. In detail, a number of power electronic topologies and both tether power transmission types, DC and AC, are possible. The proposed approach was verified by a high number of circuit simulations and by a proof-of-principle demonstrator. In all cases it was confirmed that any open circuit fault and any short circuit fault lead at the most to unavailability of only one rotor drivetrain group.},

With less effort, the winches turn similarly as if they where loaded by a real kite. As the loads are virtually present only, but hardware is involved, one may call this principle “virtual”-PHIL.

well as an estimation of the aerodynamic force and torque. Therefore, it can be applied to closed-loop control in airborne

data. The performance of the algorithm is investigated by feeding it with real flight data obtained from a low-cost and
highly portable experimental setup with a four-line kite. Several flight tests, which include pullup and lateral-directional
steeringmaneuvers with twokites of different areas, are conducted. Thecoherence of the estimations providedby the filter,

The equations of motion are obtained by using a Lagrangian formulation, which yields a low-order system of ordinary differential equations free of constraint forces. Two parameters are chosen for the analysis. The first parameter is the wind velocity. The second parameter is one of the stability derivatives of the aerodynamic model: the roll response to the sideslip angle, known also as effective dihedral. This parameter affects significantly the lateral dynamics of the kite. It has been found that when the effective dihedral is below a certain threshold, the kite follows stable periodic trajectories, and naturally flies in cross-wind conditions while generating a high tension along both tethers. This result indicates that kite-based propulsion systems could operate without controlling tether lengths if kite design, including the dihedral and sweep angles, is done appropriately. If both tether lengths are varied out-of-phase and periodically, then kite dynamics can be very complex. The trajectories are chaotic and intermittent for values of the effective dihedral below a certain negative threshold. It is found that tether tensions can be very similar with and without tether length modulation if the parameters of the model are well-chosen. The use of the model for pure traction applications of kites is discussed.},

The mechanical system comprises a kite or fixed-wing drone equipped with rotors and linked to the ground by a flexible tether. The time-dependent control vector of the simulator mimics real AWE systems and it includes the length of the main tether, the geometry of the bridle, the torque of the motor controllers of the rotors, and the deflections of ailerons, rudder and elevator. The use of a lagrangian formulation with a minimal coordinate approach and discretizing the main tether as a chain of inelastic straight rods linked by ideal (dissipative-less) rotational joints, yielded a non-stiff set of ordinary differential equations free of algebraic constraints. Several verification tests, including a reel-in maneuver that admits an analytical solution, are presented. The efficiency of the parallelization with the number of tether segments, and trade-offanalysis of the lagrangian and hamiltonian formulations are also considered. The versatility of the simulator is highlighted by analyzing two maneuvers that are relevant for AWE scenarios. First, the simulator is used to compute periodic figure-of-eight trajectories with an open-loop control law that varies the geometry of the kite’s bridle, as frequently done in ground-generation AWE systems. Second, an unstable equilibrium state of a tethered drone equipped with two rotors for energy harvesting is stabilized by implementing a closed-loop control strategy for the deflection of the control aerodynamic surfaces.},

An engineering wake induction model could simplify the (axisymmetric) aerodynamics of such an unsteady actuator-annulus with variable thrust-coefficient, flight-radius, and downwind-direction apparent velocity, in comparison to high-fidelity wake models. To the authors' knowledge, existing engineering models do not predict the influence of variable flight radius. The goal of this paper is to synthesize a MAWES engineering model, a closed-form function approximating the axial induction factor ã, specifically at the kite mid-span, using linearized wake parameters, as available from a dynamics solver. A vortex tube model is used to construct a plausible approximation of the induction, which is then heavily simplified for computation tractability while retaining important flow physics.},

  abstract  = {Summarizing the above, six types of electric machines were investigated firstly to identify feasible external rotor electric machines for the presented application, an all-automatic airborne wind energy system. After evaluating the machine designs, two types of machines, the permanent magnet synchronous machine with ferrite magnets and the reluctance synchronous machine, were investigated in detail. In both cases, key factors for innovative and practical machine dimensioning were outlined and discussed. Furthermore, the overall kite system as well as the dimensioning process for the power electronic parts were presented. Even though further investigations, especially regarding the manufacturability and the dynamic behavior, are necessary for a successful application, implementing either an external rotor PSM-FM or an external rotor RSM in an airborne wind energy system would be a new step towards a CO2-free energy supply.},

  abstract  = {Within the prevailing single-kite paradigm, the current roadmap towards utility-scale airborne wind energy (AWE) involves building ever larger aircraft. Consequently, utility-scale AWE systems increasingly suffer from similar upscaling drawbacks as conventional wind turbines. In this paper, an alternative upscaling strategy based on stacked multi-kite systems is proposed. Although multi-kite systems are well-known in the literature, the consideration of stacked configurations extends the design space even further and could allow for significantly smaller aircraft, and therefore possibly to cheaper, mass-producible utility-scale AWE systems. To assess the potential of the stacking concept, optimal control is applied to optimize both system design and flight trajectories for a range of configurations, at two different industry-relevant wind sites. The results show that the modular stacking concept effectively decouples aircraft wing sizing considerations from the total power output demand. An efficiency increase of up to 20% is reported when the harvesting area for the same amount of aircraft is doubled using a stacked configuration. Moreover, it is shown that stacked configurations can more than halve the peak power overshoot within one power cycle with respect to conventional single-kite systems.},

As consequence, system reliability, operational robustness, and safety have become crucially important aspects of system development. In this study, we analyze the reliability and safety of a 100‐kW technology development platform with the objective of achieving continuous automatic operation. We first outline the different components of the kite power system and its operational modes. In the next step, we identify failure modes, their causes, and effects by means of failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) and fault tree analysis (FTA). Potentially hazardous situations and mechanisms which can render the system nonoperational are identified, and mitigation measures are proposed. We find that the majority of these measures can be performed by a failure detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR) system for which we present a hierarchical architecture adapted from space industry.},

  abstract = {Airborne wind energy (AWE) is a wind power technology that harvests energy at high altitudes. The performance of AWE systems relative to traditional wind power turbines (WT) is of key relevance to any future commercialization. In particular, the power generation as well as its consistency over time will be key performance indicators. This study aims at identifying crucial factors that will influence the competitiveness of drag-mode AWE systems against WTs. To that end, the hourly power production of several drag-mode AWE designs is investigated using realistic wind data, and compared to the hourly power production of classical WTs. These results are then analyzed through three performance indicators: total annual power production, Gini coefficient, and correlation coefficient. The results show that AWE systems with multiple smaller wings have the highest annual production. The AWE power production of all AWE systems correlates in time at all sites with the production of WTs, and the Gini coefficients are similar. This observation challenges the belief that AWE systems will outcompete WTs thanks to a more consistent power output than WTs. However, the wing design as well as the local wind shear have a significant impact on the AWE performance.},

  pages    = {1--19},
  abstract = {Vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of wind turbine towers can be critical during the installation phase, when the rotor-nacelle assembly is not yet mounted on the tower. The present work uses numerical simulations to study VIV of a two-dimensional cylinder under conditions that are representative of wind turbine towers, both from a fluid-dynamics and structural-dynamics perspective. First, the numerical tools and fluid-structure interaction algorithm are verified by considering a cylinder vibrating freely in a laminar flow. In that case, both the motion amplitude and frequency are shown to agree well with previous results from the literature. Second, VIV is modelled in the turbulent supercritical regime using Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations. In this context, the turbulence model is first validated on flow past a stationary cylinder at high Reynolds number. Then, results from forced vibrations are validated against experimental results for a range of reduced frequencies and velocities. It is shown that the behaviour of the aerodynamic damping changes with the frequency ratio, and can therefore lead to either self-limiting or self-exciting VIV when the cylinder is left to freely vibrate. Finally, results are shown for a freely-vibrating cylinder under realistic flow and structural conditions. While a clear lock-in map is identified and shows good agreement with published numerical and experimental data, the work also highlights the unsteady nature of the aerodynamic forces and motion under certain operating conditions.},

  pages    = {1--34},
  abstract = {Airborne wind energy (AWE) systems typically harness energy in an altitude range up to 500 m above the ground. To estimate the annual energy production (AEP), measured wind speed statistics close to the ground are commonly extrapolated to higher altitudes, introducing substantial uncertainties. This study proposes a clustering procedure for obtaining wind statistics for an extended height range from reanalysis data or long-term LiDAR measurements that include the vertical variation of the wind speed and direction. K-means clustering is used to identify a set of prevailing wind profile shapes that characterise the wind resource. The methodology is demonstrated using the Dutch Offshore Wind Atlas and LiDAR observations for the locations of the met masts IJmuiden and Cabauw, 85 km off the Dutch coast in the North Sea and in the center of the Netherlands, respectively. The resulting wind profile shapes and the corresponding temporal cycles, wind properties, and atmospheric stability are in good agreement with literature. Finally, it is demonstrated how a set of wind profile shapes and their statistics can be used to estimate the AEP of a pumping AWE system. For four or more clusters, the site specific AEP error is within a few percent of the converged value.},

In this context, sampling the uncertainty on prescribed decision points gives rise to different scenarios that are linked to each other via the so-called nonanticipativity constraints. Previous work suggests to dualize these constraints and apply Newton's method on the dual problem to achieve a parallelizable scheme. However, it has been observed that the globalization strategy in such an approach can be expensive. To alleviate this problem, we propose to dualize both the nonanticipativity constraints and the dynamics to obtain a computationally cheap globalization. The dual Newton system is then reformulated into small highly structured linear systems that can be solved in parallel to a large extent. The algorithm is complemented by an open-source software implementation that targets embedded optimal control applications.},

In combination with a tailored algorithm for the calculation of the step direction, which is typically the most expensive operation per iteration, the proposed algorithm achieves a linear complexity in the number of nodes and supports parallel processing of the tree branches in a stage-wise fashion. An open-source implementation of the presented dual Newton strategy is publicly available in treeQP, a toolbox of open-source solvers for tree-sparse quadratic programs.},

placement controller, we determined the required locations of the closed-loop poles and enforced
them by adapting the control gains in real time. We compared the path-following performance of the
proposed approach with a classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller using the same
system model. The capability of the system identification algorithm to recognize sudden changes in
the dynamic model or the wind conditions, and the ability of the controller to stabilize the system
in the presence of such changes were confirmed. Furthermore, the system identification algorithm
was used to determine the parameters of a kite with variable-length tether on the basis of data that
were recorded during a physical flight test of a 20 kW kite power system. The system identification
algorithm was executed in real time, and significant changes were observed in the parameters of the
dynamic model, which strongly affect the resulting response.},
