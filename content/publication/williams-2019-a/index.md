abstract: "This paper presents the systematic approach and analysis of the flight test verification of a small-scale rigid wing airborne wind energy system. An overview of the model-based design process used to produce the embedded software is provided, together with a description of the simulation “truth” models. Important aspects of sensor modelling that impact the flight control design are highlighted. The control design process is elaborated and a description of the verification methods used to provide assurance that the embedded software is fit for purpose is given. Flight test results for typical flight conditions are presented for launch, power generation, and landing."
