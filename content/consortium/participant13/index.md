The Laboratory for Mechatronic and Renewable Energy Systems (LMRES) was founded in 2018 by Prof. Dr. [Christoph Hackl](/authors/christoph-m-hackl). The research of the laboratory focuses on energy efficient, optimal and robust control strategies for renewable energy systems. Its interdisciplinary expertise is based on the combination of engineering disciplines like electrical drives, power electronics and mechatronics and the mathematical discipline systems and control theory. At the moment, we work on (a) modeling of micro-grids (four-wire system) and (b) modeling and control of the electrical components of airborne wind energy systems, biogas power plants, small-scale and large-scale wind turbine systems, geothermal power plants and electric vehicles
