The AWESCO researchers will be hosted in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and the Turbulent Flow Simulation & Optimization (TFSO) research group. The group consists of 9 PhD students and one postdoctoral researcher and has large competency in large-eddy simulation and direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows, PDE-constrained optimization, super computing (including access to facilities), wind energy, atmospheric dispersion, etc. Moreover, for its simulation and optimization research, an in-house state of the art PDE-constrained DNS/LES-based optimization code (i.e. SP-Wind) is available in the team. In addition, J.M. is one of the core supervisors of OPTEC (OPTimization in Engineering Center of Excellence @ KU Leuven â€“ http://set.kuleuven.be/optec/), and chairs a working group on PDE-constrained optimization. AWESCO researchers will be fully included in the OPTEC activities, meetings, training, etc. Finally, the TFSO team is also heavily involved in a multi-disciplinary wind-energy research consortium at KU Leuven, including teams from structural mechanics, electrical engineering, and climatology. The consortium organizes two-monthly meetings that focus on interdisciplinary training, and discussion. The AWESCO ESR will be naturally involved.
