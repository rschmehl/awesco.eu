The team at Chalmers are Marie-Skłodowska-Curie Fellow [Elena Malz](/authors/elena-malz) and her adviser Prof. Dr. [Sébastien Gros](/authors/sebastien-gros), both with the [Automatic Control Research Group](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/e2/research/systems-and-control/Pages/Automatic-control.aspx). The research on airborne wind energy benefits from the leading expertise of the university on Power Systems and Power Grids as well as the latest research on using Optimal Control in the context of Electrical Networks. Since 2019 the team is part of a larger university-funded project [Interdisciplinary Assessment of Airborne Wind Energy](https://www.chalmers.se/en/projects/Pages/Interdisciplinary-Assessment-of-Airborne-Wind-Energy.aspx), following up on the AWESCO project.
