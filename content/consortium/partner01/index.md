title: Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)
summary: Delft University of Technology is the oldest and largest technical university of the Netherlands. Its Faculty of Aerospace Engineering is one of the largest in Europe and is home to the Kite Power Research Group. As pioneer in Airborne Wind Energy this group has developed a 20 kW pumping kite power system, demonstrating automatic operation in 2012.

The AWESCO researchers will be hosted in the section of Wind Energy of the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering and will have full access to scientific staff and research infrastructure. This will include the wind tunnels of the faculty, of which the largest, the Open Jet Facility, can fit scaled-down kite of 2 m span wing span. Custom-developed pressure measurement strips for experimental analysis of flexible membrane wings. Computational facilities include a cluster with 1000 cores of 4.5 TB RAM memory (target is 4 GB RAM/core), mostly connected through infiniband. The Kite Power Research Group currently comprises 3 PhD researchers and 14 graduate researchers. Since January 2010, the team is operating a 20 kW prototype system which is equipped with a 25 m² kite and a complete sensor platform to support the parallel research activities. Two test sites, the former airfield Valkenburg and the Maasvlakte2 harbour area, can be used through rental agreements. The high tech entrepreneurs centre [YES!Delft](https://www.yesdelft.com/) is available to support commercial spin-off activities.
