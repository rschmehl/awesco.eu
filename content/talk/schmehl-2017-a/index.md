title: EU H2020 Projects AWESCO & REACH
event: Airborne Wind Energy Conference 2017
event_url: http://www.awec2017.com
location: Freiburg, Germany
summary: Advancing Airborne Wind Energy Technologies by Systematic Research and Development
abstract: "Airborne wind energy is the central theme of several projects funded by the European Union within its framework programme Horizon 2020. This presentation highlights two specific projects that are coordinated by TU Delft, [AWESCO](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/193938/en) and [REACH](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/199241/en), illustrating how the two parallel actions not only complement each other but create a synergy effect, interleaving also with other parallel actions. Examples for parallel actions are the projects [AMPYXAP3](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/197306/en), [EK200-AWESOME](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/205145/en) and [NextWind](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/210686/en), all in the SME Instrument scheme, however, in different phases."
